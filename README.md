# What's That Keyboard

This is a little web-based game I created. I learned lots by making it! :-)

## The Game

Without looking at your keyboard, think you can remember the positions of all the letter keys?

You may not know the exact arrangement, but perhaps you remember some words you've physically typed before, that can help you visualize where each letter should go? That's how I go about it at least! I think using these words to recall the keyboard is an interesting application of spatial memory. While this might be a fun challenge, it's one-time with the QWERTY layout.

That's why I created _What's That Keyboard_. It's a game centered around this concept. Each day features a completely new layout, so the challenge continues on!

You can play the game here: 

**P.S** There are still some features I would like to implement: Statistics, Settings, and Easy and Hard game modes.

## Learning Outcomes
I also made this project because I wanted to become familiar with the core web technologiesâ€”**HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.

Indeed, throughout this project I've had to:
- Design and build out numerous UI components
- Handle events of varying nature (e.g. keyboard input, drag and drop)
- Dynamically update the DOM

As the project grew, I decided to adopt the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern** for better seperation of concerns and code organization. My next goal was then to learn how to implement the pattern.

The main challenges I faced were:
- Defining the role, or scope of each component
- Deciding how the components would interact with each other

  Overall, I'm glad I chose the MVC pattern and faced these challenges! So far, this structure has helped me integrate new features and make improvements more easily.
